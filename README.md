# Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler (Basic - Recommended)

##### _Because that Rock Paper Scissors Game is Too Damn Hard_

### Overview

In this assignment, I create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. It retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Requirements

* I made sure the app met these basic spec:
  
  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * The code calculates when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
  
  * Users from many different machines must be able to view the same train times.
